	<p>Hey, I'm Harry! I am a software developer, musician, writer and passionate traveller. Software development is my day job, everything else I do as a hobby. Though I do have a degree in Popular and World Music from the University of Leeds and if I ever successfully rob a bank, I will become a full-time world traveller.</p>
	<p>This is unashamably a site dedicated to me, however I promise I am not an ego-maniac... well not much of one anyway. The purpose of this site is to showcase my work. That, and to make use of the the domain I felt inclined to purchase.</p>
	<h2>So, a bit about me</h2>
	<p>After graduating in 2013, I soon realised, along with my coursemates, that the music industry didn't need another batch of fresh music graduates ready to fill countless exciting vacancies. So I took the things I loved about music and went in search for another career. Through what I can only describe as good luck I was able to get a place on the Technology Graduate Scheme at Sky in London.</p>
	<p>The idea with any graduate scheme is to give you a taste of different parts of the business while working in different functions. But in reality, if you can find a team and a role that suits you, it's a good idea not to drift too away from it. My role of choice was Web Developer and I spent two years learning the trade from some of best professionals in the industry.</p>
	<p>Once I had completed the graduate scheme at Sky, I decided to explore another passion that I had developed - travelling. In 2015 I visited India, The Phillipines, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Laos, Cambodia and I even dropped into Burma, although just for a few hours. While I was away I took on freelance projects, both to keep me developing and to fund my travels.</p>
	<p>Since leaving university I have been involved a lot with the digital newspaper, The London Economic. It was started in 2013 by my mate Jack Peat and has grown massively since then. Thanks in no smallpart to the political turmoil of recent times. I have worked both as a web developer and a writer for it in my spare time, including a brief period as Music Editor. I am currently working on a mobile app for it which should be released later this summer.</p>
	<p>I now work at ASDA head office in Leeds, working with technologies such as Angular, Ionic and Typescript to developa range of apps for different functions throughout the business.</p>
	<p>If I haven't bored you enough already, please have a look at my articles and development pages to see some of the work I have done.</p>
	<p>Thanks, Harry!</p>
